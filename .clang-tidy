# Some notes on the checks down below. This has to be up here because
# if it is put directly next to the checks, it breaks the parser somehow.
#
# - readability-identifier-length
#
#   this check enforces a minimum of 3 characters for variable names which
#   unfairly rejects common short identifiers like i, j, n, m, p, and k making
#   the rule more annoying than useful.
